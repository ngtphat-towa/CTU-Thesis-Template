=== Research Methodology

This thesis employs a combination of research methods:

==== 1. Literature Review
Comprehensive analysis of existing e-commerce platforms, software architecture patterns, and modern web development technologies.

==== 2. Design Science Research
Following the design science methodology, this research involves:
- Problem identification
- Solution design
- Implementation
- Evaluation
- Communication of results

==== 3. Experimental Evaluation
Performance testing and usability studies to validate the proposed solution.

=== Technical Approach

The technical approach consists of several key components:

*Backend Architecture*:
- ASP.NET Core 8.0 for REST APIs
- Entity Framework Core for data access
- PostgreSQL with pgvector for database
- FastAPI for machine learning services

*Frontend Architecture*:
- Vue.js 3 with Composition API
- PrimeVue component library
- Pinia for state management
- Vite for build tooling

*Infrastructure*:
- Docker for containerization
- YARP reverse proxy as API gateway
- Redis for caching (optional)
- Git for version control

=== Development Phases

The development is structured in phases:

1. Requirements analysis and system design
2. Backend API development
3. Frontend implementation
4. Integration and testing
5. Deployment and documentation
