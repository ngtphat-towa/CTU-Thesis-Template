Several e-commerce platforms have been developed in both academic and commercial contexts. This section reviews existing solutions and identifies gaps that this thesis addresses.

=== Commercial Platforms

Popular platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce, and Magento provide comprehensive e-commerce solutions. However, they often come with limitations:

- *Shopify*: While user-friendly, it has limited customization options and vendor lock-in concerns
- *WooCommerce*: Highly customizable but can suffer from performance issues at scale
- *Magento*: Enterprise-grade but requires significant infrastructure and expertise

=== Academic Research

Recent academic work has explored various aspects of e-commerce systems:

1. Performance optimization techniques @textbook2024
2. User experience design patterns
3. Security and payment processing methodologies
4. Inventory management algorithms

=== Research Gap

Despite these contributions, there remains a need for open-source, educational e-commerce platforms that demonstrate modern software engineering practices while maintaining production-ready quality. This thesis fills this gap by providing a comprehensive reference implementation.
