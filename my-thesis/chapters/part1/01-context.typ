== Context and Problem Statement

In recent years, the rapid growth of e-commerce has transformed the retail industry. Traditional brick-and-mortar stores are increasingly moving online to reach a broader customer base. However, developing a robust e-commerce platform presents several challenges including inventory management, payment processing, and user experience optimization.

The main problem addressed in this thesis is the lack of integrated solutions that combine modern web technologies with efficient backend systems. Many existing platforms struggle with scalability, performance, and maintainability issues as business requirements evolve.

This research focuses on designing and implementing a comprehensive e-commerce system using modern technologies such as ASP.NET Core, Vue.js, and PostgreSQL. The system aims to demonstrate best practices in software architecture, including microservices, API gateway patterns, and responsive user interfaces.

According to recent studies @example2023, the global e-commerce market is expected to reach \$6.3 trillion by 2024, highlighting the importance of robust online retail solutions.
